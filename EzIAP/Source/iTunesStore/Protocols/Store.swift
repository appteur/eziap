/**
 This protocol defines an interface for an applications store within the app.
 
 An implementation of this protocol could provide product lists and management and encapsulate all store logic for displaying products to the user and handling/initiating calls to purchase products within the app, or this logic could be broken up further based on responsibilities.
 
 See the 'GeneralStore' class in this framework or the 'DemoStore' class in the accompanying sample application for sample use/implementation cases.
