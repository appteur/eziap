/// This class provides the main interface for communicating with iTunesConnect/AppStoreConnect.
///
/// It provides functionality to:
///   * Validate products, aka verifying the products are setup and available to purchase in the App Store.
///   * Purchase products.
///   * Restore previously purchased products.
///
/// ### Usage Notes
/// An instance of this class can be used standalone in any of your classes if desired for maximum flexibility.
/// However, it is designed to be used from an object conforming to the `Store` protocol. Using it in this way gives you some default behaviors for free and allows simpler integration with your local product models.
///
/// A default implementation of the Store protocol is included in this framework. (See the `GeneralStore` class).
///
/// A class using an instance of iTunesStore should set itself as the delegate.
/// Doing so will allow you to receive callbacks regarding:
///   * The status of product validation requests.
///   * Notification of any invalid products.
///   * The status of current purchase transactions.
///   * The status of current restore requests.
///
/// For example implementations & use cases look at:
///   * GeneralStore class included in this framework.
///   * DemoStore class included in the accompanying sample application.
