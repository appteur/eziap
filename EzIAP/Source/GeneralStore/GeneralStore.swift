 This class provides a default implementation of the `Store` protocol and is designed to bootstrap projects that do not require complex purchasing rules.

 ### Usage
 
 A basic use case could look something like this:
 ```Swift
 
 var store: Store!
 
 init() {
    store = setupStore()
 }

 internal func setupStore() -> GeneralStore {
 
    let store = GeneralStore()
 
    store.onTransactionInitiated = { status in
        self.showSpinner(true)
    }
 
    store.onTransactionComplete = { status in
        self.showSpinner(false)
 
        if let productID = status.transaction?.payment.productIdentifier {
 
            // Store product id in UserDefaults or some other method of tracking purchases
            UserDefaults.standard.set(true , forKey: productID)
            UserDefaults.standard.synchronize()
        }
    }
 
    store.onTransactionCancelled = { status in
        self.showSpinner(false)
    }
 
    store.onTransactionFailed = { status in
        self.showSpinner(false)
        if let error = status.error {
            print("Purchase Error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
        }
    }
 
    return store
 }
 
 ```
